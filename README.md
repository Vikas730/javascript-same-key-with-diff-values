# javascript-same-key-with-diff-values

This is a javascript code which is used for checking an array of objects with the same key name as "day" and concatenate its "start" and "end" values with a comma seprator

In this code we have used a custom object array name as "myarray", we have created an object and inside it an array object name as "hours" and then inside it again an array object name as "open" and inside this multiple objects with the key and values. Then I have written javascript code for checking the same key name as "day" match this and then concatenate its "start" and "end" values with a comma seprator. you can see the result into the console.
